# URL Shortener App

This is a SwiftUI application designed to shorten URLs. 
It utilizes native async/await for asynchronous operations, SwiftData for data persistence, and follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. The code emphasizes modularity, using protocols extensively, and employs dependency injection managed through the "Factory" library.
